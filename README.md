# naked_ui

**Unstyled Flutter components that you design.**

Build buttons, inputs, menus, and dialogs that look exactly how you want them. Naked UI handles all the complex behaviorâ€”keyboard navigation, accessibility, focus managementâ€”while you control every pixel of the design.

## Why Naked UI?

**Complete design control.** Every component is completely unstyledâ€”no theme overrides or framework limitations.

**Built-in accessibility.** All components include keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and touch interactions.

**Consistent API.** Every component follows the same pattern: wrap your design, receive state updates, customize appearance.

## Quick example

```dart
NakedButton(
  onPressed: () => print('Hello!'),
  builder: (context, state, child) {
    return Container(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(12),
      color: state.isPressed ? Colors.blue : Colors.grey,
      child: Text('Press me!'),
    );
  },
)
```

This creates a fully accessible button with press state handling. The component also supports hover and focus states. Customize appearance with borders, animations, gradients, or any styling.
